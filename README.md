TASK : Implement a customizable web dashboard.
● The dashboard must simply contain a grid of 9 cells (check the mockup below).
● Each cell must include a colored button. Clicking the button must navigate the user to
previously set hyperlink.
● In case the hyperlink is not set yet, then on button click the user must be navigated to
another page, where the user would have the opportunity to set the button’s
configuration (hyperlink + color).
● The task includes database design (SQL), backend implementation (PHP/Laravel),
frontend implementation (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
